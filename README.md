angular-fabric-lite
==============

`bower install angular-fabric-lite`

This is a fork of [angular-fabric](https://github.com/michaeljcalkins/angular-fabric), which is good but has way more than I needed for my project. I wanted a simple way to interact with Fabric as angular services. See original project for example of usage, or look at troylelandshields/murinal(https://github.com/troylelandshields/murinal).
